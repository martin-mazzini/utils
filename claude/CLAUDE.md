- Assume plans/memories are in ./memories (git-ignored). If the filename I give is inexact (typo, no .md), list the folder and pick the obvious match.
- Never write code comments unless explicitly requested.
- Code references must be clickable and concise:
  - Format: relative/path.ext:lineNumber
  - Keep paths short (avoid wrapping)
  - Examples: src/index.ts:45, package.json:12
- Be concise: Every extra word is noise. Skip fluff, jargon, or showy language. Focus on signal.
