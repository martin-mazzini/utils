  description: Review current branch
  ---

  ## Context
  You need to run git diff to
  see the changes:
  git diff origin/master...HEAD

  ## Task
  After running the git diff
  command above, review the code
   changes.

  1. **Scope and motivation**
     - Summarise what was
  implemented and why.
     - If the reason is not
  obvious, state a clear
  assumption label
  `[Assumption]`.

  2. **State change**
     - Describe the previous
  behaviour or state.
     - Describe the new
  behaviour or state that the
  change achieves.

  3. **Key changes**
     - Walk through the diff in
  a human-friendly order.
     - For each affected file,
  explain how business logic,
  data flow, or APIs were
  modified.
     - Highlight the simplest
  mental model to understand the
   update.

  4. **Minor tweaks and 
  clean-ups**
     - Briefly note small
  refactors, renames, or style
  fixes.

  5. **Follow-up Q&A**
     - End with a line:
       `Let me know what part
  you want to dig into and I
  will explain further.`

  Rules for this review:
  - Keep the first pass succinct
   â€“ prioritise clarity over
  exhaustiveness.
  - Never invent facts. If
  something cannot be concluded,
   say **"Not enough 
  information"**.
  - Use bullets and short
  paragraphs. Avoid wall-of-text
   responses.
