Describe the testing strategy used in this codebase.

Usage: /explainTesting $ARGUMENTS

Instructions for Claude:
1. Identify testing frameworks and tools:
   - Unit test frameworks
   - Integration test setup
   - End-to-end test tools
   - Performance testing tools
   - Security testing approaches
2. Analyze test organization:
   - Test file locations and naming conventions
   - Test structure and patterns
   - Test data management
   - Fixture and factory patterns
3. Evaluate test coverage:
   - Well-tested areas vs. gaps
   - Coverage metrics and thresholds
   - Critical path coverage
   - Edge case handling
4. Document testing patterns:
   - Mocking and stubbing strategies
   - Test doubles (spies, fakes, stubs)
   - Contract/API testing
   - Database testing approaches
   - External service mocking
5. Review test execution:
   - Local test commands
   - CI/CD test stages
   - Test parallelization
   - Flaky test handling
   - Test reporting
6. Identify:
   - Testing best practices in use
   - Anti-patterns or technical debt
   - Missing test types
   - Opportunities for improvement
7. If $ARGUMENTS highlights specific areas, focus analysis there
8. Note confidence mechanisms and what assumptions are verified

The output should reveal the quality assurance approach and testing maturity level.

9. Memory Management:
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains "no memory", just display the analysis
   - Otherwise (default), save the analysis to memories/analysis/09-testing.md
   - Create the memories/analysis directory if it doesn't exist
   - Include timestamp and codebase name in the memory file
