I want you to help me understand a source code file I’m passing to you.

Here’s what I need you to do:

1. **Assume I have only a vague understanding of what this file does.** Treat this like an onboarding session. 
2. First, give me a **brief summary** of what this file does overall: what is its purpose, what kind of logic it implements, how it fits into a larger system if that's apparent.
3. Then, go through the file and **add inline comments directly into the code** that:
   - Explain the **overall structure and flow** of the file.
   - Clarify what each major block or function is doing.
   - Highlight any important data structures, patterns, or dependencies being used.
   - Help me understand the intent behind the logic — not just *what* it does but *why* it might do it that way.
   - Are **not constrained by brevity**: use full sentences or paragraphs if needed. Think like a teacher writing notes for a student.
   - Can explain unrelated parts of the file too — even if I didn’t highlight them — if it helps me build a clearer mental model.
   - **Ignore whether these comments are production-quality or not**. Your goal is for me to **understand the file**, not keep it clean.
   - Use comment syntax appropriate for the file’s language (e.g., `//` or `#` or `/* ... */`).

You don’t need to summarize at the end — just give me the commented version of the file and maybe a brief description at the top before the commented code.

This is not a formal code review — it’s a **code comprehension pass**, meant to teach me what this file is doing in depth.
