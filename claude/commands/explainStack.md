Enumerate the main technologies used in the codebase.

Usage: /explainStack $ARGUMENTS

Instructions for Claude:
1. Analyze package files, configuration, and code to identify all technologies
2. Categorize findings into:
   - Programming languages (with versions if available)
   - Major frameworks or libraries by layer:
     - Backend frameworks and libraries
     - Frontend frameworks and libraries
     - Infrastructure and deployment tools
   - Tooling for:
     - Building and bundling
     - Testing frameworks
     - Linting and code quality
     - Formatting and static analysis
   - Package managers, CLIs, or monorepo tools (e.g., pnpm, Lerna, Bazel)
3. Note specific versions where relevant
4. Identify any custom or proprietary technologies
5. Highlight the primary/core technologies vs. supporting tools
6. If $ARGUMENTS specifies particular areas of interest, provide deeper analysis
7. Create a comprehensive tech landscape map beyond just "Node + React"
8. Include:
   - Why each technology was likely chosen
   - How technologies work together
   - Any notable patterns or conventions

The output should provide a complete picture of the technical choices and tooling ecosystem.

9. Memory Management:
   - If $ARGUMENTS contains "no memory", just display the analysis
   - Otherwise (default), save the analysis to memories/analysis/03-stack.md
   - Create the memories/analysis directory if it doesn't exist
   - Include timestamp and codebase name in the memory file
