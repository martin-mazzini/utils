Provide a comprehensive analysis of this codebase covering all major aspects.

Usage: /explainCodebase $ARGUMENTS

Instructions for Claude:
1. Launch specialized agents in parallel to analyze different aspects of the codebase
2. Use the Task tool to run the following agents concurrently:
   - Agent 1: Analyze project overview and purpose
   - Agent 2: Document setup and local development
   - Agent 3: Enumerate technology stack
   - Agent 4: Examine infrastructure and deployment
   - Agent 5: Understand code architecture
   - Agent 6: Map API surface and behavior
   - Agent 7: Identify dependencies and integrations
   - Agent 8: Trace data flow patterns
   - Agent 9: Evaluate testing strategy
3. Each agent should perform deep analysis of their specific domain
4. After all agents complete, aggregate findings into a cohesive report covering:
   - Executive summary
   - System purpose and value
   - Technical architecture overview
   - Key components and their interactions
   - Deployment and operations
   - Development workflow
   - Quality assurance approach
   - Risks and recommendations
5. If $ARGUMENTS specifies particular areas of focus, ensure agents prioritize those
6. Present findings in a well-structured document that provides both high-level insights and technical details
7. Include cross-references between different aspects where relevant

The final output should provide a complete understanding of the codebase suitable for onboarding, auditing, or architectural review.
