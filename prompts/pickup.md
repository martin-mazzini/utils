# Pickup Branch Context

Review and understand the complete state of the current git branch:

1. **Branch History**: Run `git log --oneline --graph --decorate origin/master..HEAD` to see all commits since diverging from master
2. **Committed Changes**: Run `git diff HEAD` to review all committed changes in this branch
3. **Uncommitted Changes**: Run `git status` and `git diff HEAD` to see staged and unstaged modifications
4. **Branch Purpose**: Based on the above, infer what this branch is implementing and its current progress

Provide a concise summary of:
- What the branch is trying to achieve
- What has been completed
- What remains uncommitted
- Current state and next logical steps
