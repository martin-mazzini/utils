Create a comprehensive implementation plan for a specific feature or task.

Usage: /plan [topic] [description]

Instructions for AI Assistant:
1. Think through the implementation approach for the feature described in [description]
2. Read relevant files, images, or URLs to understand the current codebase - use either general pointers ("read the file that handles logging") or specific filenames ("read logging.py")
3. Do NOT write any code during this planning phase - focus only on understanding and planning
4. Create a detailed implementation plan in `./memories/plans/[topic].md` within the current working directory
5. Use "think", "think hard", "think harder", or "ultrathink" to trigger extended thinking mode for more thorough evaluation of alternatives
6. Structure the plan with clear steps, considerations, and approach
7. If [description] contains additional guidelines beyond the feature specification, follow those guidelines and give them precedence over these instructions
8. Include relevant file locations, existing patterns to follow, and potential challenges
9. Make the plan comprehensive enough to guide implementation without requiring additional planning

The plan should serve as a complete roadmap for implementing the described feature.
